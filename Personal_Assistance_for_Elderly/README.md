# 🆘 Voice-Activated Emergency & Reminder Assistant 🤖

This is a voice-controlled assistant built with Python. It can recognize emergency commands, set voice-based reminders, and tell the current time and date.

## 🧠 Features

- 🗣️ Voice input using `speech_recognition`
- 🔊 Text-to-speech feedback via `pyttsx3`
- 🆘 Emergency contact handling (name or number)
- ⏰ Voice-activated reminders (with delay)
- 🕒 Tells current time and date
- 🔐 Thread-safe speaking using a locking mechanism

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Microphone and speakers
- Internet connection (for speech recognition)

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

> Tip: If `pyaudio` fails to install, refer to OS-specific installation guides or use precompiled binaries from [Gohlke's repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).
